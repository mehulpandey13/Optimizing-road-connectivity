# Optimizing-road-connectivity
Hack-ASOL Hackathon Project: Road Connectivity Optimization
Project Overview
This project, developed for the Hack-ASOL hackathon, aims to optimize road connectivity in rural and hilly regions of India. The goal is to address the challenges associated with poor road infrastructure, which impacts economic development, accessibility, and quality of life.

Objectives
Identify Critical Road Segments: Use OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to identify road segments with poor conditions and limited connectivity.
Optimize Road Network: Apply machine learning techniques, including Dijkstra's algorithm, to determine the optimal paths and suggest new road connections.
Enhance Infrastructure: Provide actionable insights to improve road infrastructure, focusing on efficiency and accessibility in underserved areas.
Features
Data Integration: Utilizes comprehensive OSM data to analyze and visualize the road network.
Algorithm Implementation: Employs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths and optimize road connections.
Visualization: Includes visual representations of road conditions and connectivity issues to aid in decision-making.
How It Works
Data Collection: Download and process road network data using the OpenStreetMap API.
Analysis: Identify roads with poor conditions and limited alternative paths.
Optimization: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest and most efficient paths between nodes.
Recommendation: Suggest new road connections and improvements to enhance network efficiency.
